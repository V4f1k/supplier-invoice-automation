# 1. Introduction

This document outlines the overall project architecture for the Invoice OCR & AI Extraction Service, including backend systems, shared services, and non-UI specific concerns. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

**Relationship to Frontend Architecture:**
If the project includes a significant user interface, a separate Frontend Architecture Document will detail the frontend-specific design and MUST be used in conjunction with this document. Core technology stack choices documented herein (see "Tech Stack") are definitive for the entire project, including any frontend components.

## 1.1. Starter Template or Existing Project

Based on the PRD, the project will use Python and FastAPI. No specific starter template was mentioned. While we can build this from scratch, using a well-structured starter template can accelerate setup, enforce best practices, and provide a solid foundation.

**Recommendation:** I recommend using a standard FastAPI starter template, such as one that includes pre-configured Docker support, dependency management with Poetry, and a logical directory structure. This aligns with the PRD's technical assumptions and will save initial setup time.

**Decision:** We will proceed with the understanding that a standard FastAPI project structure will be created manually, as no starter template is specified.
