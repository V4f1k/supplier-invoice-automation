# 12. Error Handling Strategy

This section defines a robust strategy for handling and logging errors, which is critical for a production-ready service.

## 12.1. General Approach

-   **Error Model:** A centralized exception handling middleware will be implemented in FastAPI. This middleware will catch all unhandled exceptions, log them, and return a standardized JSON error response, as defined in the `ApiError` schema of our OpenAPI specification.
-   **Exception Hierarchy:** We will define a hierarchy of custom exception classes inheriting from a base `AppException` (e.g., `OcrError`, `AiServiceError`, `InvalidFileTypeError`). This allows our service logic to raise specific, meaningful exceptions that can be caught and handled appropriately by the middleware.

## 12.2. Logging Standards

-   **Library:** `Loguru` will be used for logging.
-   **Format:** Structured JSON. This allows for easy parsing and filtering in log management systems.
-   **Required Context:** Every log entry, where possible, will include a unique `request_id`. This ID will be generated at the start of each API call and passed through the service components, allowing us to trace the entire lifecycle of a single request through the logs.

## 12.3. Error Handling Patterns

-   **External API Errors:**
    -   **Retry Policy:** For transient network errors or rate limit issues (HTTP 429) when calling the Gemini API, the `AI Service` will implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff.
    -   **Circuit Breaker:** To prevent the service from being overwhelmed by a failing external API, a circuit breaker pattern will be implemented. After a certain number of consecutive failures, the circuit will "open" and fail fast for subsequent requests for a configured period, preventing cascading failures.
-   **Business Logic Errors:**
    -   **Custom Exceptions:** Invalid inputs or business rule violations (e.g., a file that is not an invoice) will be handled by raising specific custom exceptions (e.g., `NotAnInvoiceError`). The middleware will map these to a `400 Bad Request` response.
