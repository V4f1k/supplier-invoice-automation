# 17. Next Steps

With the architecture now fully defined, the following steps can be taken:

1.  **Review and Approval:** The Product Owner should review and approve this completed architecture document.
2.  **Story Implementation:** The `dev` agent can now begin implementing the user stories, using this document as the definitive guide. The first story should focus on setting up the project structure defined in the "Source Tree" section.
3.  **Infrastructure Setup:** The initial infrastructure (e.g., setting up the Hetzner VM, Docker) can be prepared in parallel with development.
