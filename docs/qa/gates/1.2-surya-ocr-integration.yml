# Quality Gate Decision for Story 1.2: Surya-OCR Integration

# Required fields (keep these first)
schema: 1
story: "1.2"
story_title: "Surya-OCR Integration"
gate: "CONCERNS" # PASS|CONCERNS|FAIL|WAIVED
status_reason: "Core functionality implemented correctly with comprehensive tests, but API test inconsistencies and missing dependency management concerns require attention"
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"

# Always present but only active when WAIVED
waiver: { active: false }

# Issues (if any) - Use fixed severity: low | medium | high
top_issues:
  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "API tests had inconsistent response format expectations (text vs structured data)"
    suggested_action: "Fixed during review - tests now align with structured API responses"
  - id: "DEP-001"
    severity: medium  
    finding: "Core OCR dependencies (surya-ocr, pymupdf) are commented out in pyproject.toml"
    suggested_action: "Uncomment and install dependencies when available, or document fallback strategy"
  - id: "ARCH-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "File format validation happened after mock mode check, bypassing validation in tests"
    suggested_action: "Fixed during review - validation now occurs before mock mode"

  totals: { critical: 0, high: 0, medium: 2, low: 1 }
  recommendations:
    must_fix: ["Resolve dependency availability before production"]
