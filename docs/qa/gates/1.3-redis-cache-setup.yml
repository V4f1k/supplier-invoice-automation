# Requirements traceability summary
acceptance_criteria_coverage:
  1: "âœ… Redis 7.2 service in docker-compose.yml - IMPLEMENTED and TESTED"
  2: "âœ… CacheService with Redis connection - IMPLEMENTED with enhanced connection management"  
  3: "âœ… get, set, check methods implemented - IMPLEMENTED with comprehensive error handling"
