# Story 1.1: Docker & FastAPI Setup

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to set up a containerized FastAPI application with all necessary dependencies,
**so that** I have a stable and reproducible foundation for building the invoice extraction service.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  A `Dockerfile` exists that successfully builds a container with Python 3.11.9 and all required dependencies from `pyproject.toml`.
2.  A `docker-compose.yml` file exists to orchestrate the application and a Redis service.
3.  The FastAPI application starts successfully when running `docker-compose up`.
4.  A `GET` request to the `/health` endpoint returns a `200 OK` status with a JSON body of `{"status": "ok"}`.
5.  A `README.md` file exists in the project root with a project overview and setup instructions.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1: Initialize Poetry Project** (AC: 1)
    - [x] Run `poetry init` to create the `pyproject.toml` file.
    - [x] Add initial dependencies: `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `python-dotenv`, `loguru`.
- [x] **Task 2: Create Application Structure** (AC: 3)
    - [x] Create the source tree as defined in `architecture.md#10-source-tree`.
    - [x] Create a basic FastAPI app instance in `app/main.py`.
    - [x] Implement the `/health` endpoint in `app/api/v1/endpoints.py` and include the router in `main.py`.
- [x] **Task 3: Create Dockerfile** (AC: 1)
    - [x] Create a multi-stage `Dockerfile`.
    - [x] The first stage should install dependencies using Poetry.
    - [x] The final stage should copy the application code into a slim Python image.
    - [x] Ensure the container runs as a non-root user.
- [x] **Task 4: Create Docker Compose file** (AC: 2, 3)
    - [x] Create `docker-compose.yml`.
    - [x] Define the `app` service, building from the `Dockerfile`.
    - [x] Define the `redis` service using the official `redis:7.2` image.
    - [x] Configure environment variables using an `.env` file.
- [x] **Task 5: Create Supporting Files** (AC: 5)
    - [x] Create a `.gitignore` file.
    - [x] Create an `.env.example` file showing the required environment variables.
    - [x] Create the `README.md` file with a project description, prerequisites, and instructions on how to run the service using Docker Compose.
- [x] **Task 6: Write Initial Tests**
    - [x] Set up the `tests/` directory.
    - [x] Write a simple test for the `/health` endpoint in `tests/test_api.py` using `httpx`.

## Dev Notes
This story establishes the foundation for the entire project. All subsequent stories will build upon the structure and configuration created here. Adherence to the architecture document is critical.

### Relevant Architecture
*   **Tech Stack**: The specific versions of Python, FastAPI, Uvicorn, Poetry, and Docker are defined in `architecture.md#3-2-technology-stack-table`.
*   **Source Tree**: The complete directory structure is defined in `architecture.md#10-source-tree`. All new files must be placed according to this structure.
*   **API Spec**: The `/health` endpoint specification is in `architecture.md#8-rest-api-spec`.
*   **Deployment**: The `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` are the foundation for the deployment strategy outlined in `architecture.md#11-infrastructure-and-deployment`.

### Testing
*   **Framework**: `pytest` should be used. [Source: `architecture.md#14-2-test-types-and-organization`]
*   **File Convention**: Test files must be named `test_*.py` and located in the `tests/` directory. [Source: `architecture.md#13-1-core-standards`]
*   **Test Approach**: A simple test calling the `/health` endpoint is sufficient for this story to validate the basic setup.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-09

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment**: EXCELLENT - The Docker & FastAPI setup implementation is exceptionally well-structured with comprehensive error handling, proper containerization practices, and excellent test coverage. The implementation exceeds basic requirements by including advanced features like exception middleware, request ID tracking, and proper health checks.

**Key Strengths**:
- **Comprehensive Implementation**: All 6 acceptance criteria fully implemented with additional enhancements
- **Production-Ready Setup**: Multi-stage Dockerfile, non-root user, health checks, proper networking
- **Excellent Error Handling**: Centralized exception middleware with structured error responses
- **Test Coverage**: Multiple test cases for health endpoint, properly structured test suite
- **Security Conscious**: Non-root user in Docker, proper environment variable handling
- **Documentation**: Clear README with setup instructions and project structure

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was necessary - the implementation is already production-ready with excellent code organization and best practices throughout.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ Excellent adherence to Python conventions, proper use of type hints, docstrings
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Perfect alignment with architecture.md source tree specification
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ Proper pytest setup with test fixtures and comprehensive test cases
