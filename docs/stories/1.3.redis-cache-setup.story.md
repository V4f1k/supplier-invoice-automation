# Story 1.3: Redis Cache Setup

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** system,
**I want** to cache the results of processed invoices in Redis,
**so that** I can reduce processing time and API costs for repeated requests.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The `docker-compose.yml` file includes a `redis` service using the `redis:7.2` image.
2. A `CacheService` is implemented that connects to the Redis instance.
3. The service provides methods to `get`, `set`, and `check` for a key in the cache.
4. When setting a key, a Time-To-Live (TTL) of 24 hours (86400 seconds) is applied.
5. The key used for caching is a SHA-256 hash of the input invoice file.
6. The `/extract` endpoint is modified to check the cache before performing OCR. If a result is found, it is returned immediately with a `cached: true` flag in the response.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1: Update Docker Compose** (AC: 1)
    - [x] Add the `redis` service to `docker-compose.yml`.
    - [x] Ensure the `app` service has the necessary environment variables to connect to Redis (e.g., `REDIS_HOST`).
- [x] **Task 2: Implement Cache Service** (AC: 2, 3, 4)
    - [x] Create `app/services/cache_service.py`.
    - [x] Implement a class `CacheService` that initializes a connection to Redis using the `redis-py` library.
    - [x] Create a `get(key)` method.
    - [x] Create a `set(key, value)` method that uses a 24-hour TTL.
- [x] **Task 3: Implement Hashing Utility** (AC: 5)
    - [x] Create a utility function (e.g., in a new `app/utils.py` file) that takes the content of an uploaded file and returns its SHA-256 hash.
- [x] **Task 4: Integrate Cache Logic into API Endpoint** (AC: 6)
    - [x] In the `/extract` endpoint in `app/api/v1/endpoints.py`, first calculate the hash of the uploaded file.
    - [x] Use the `CacheService` to check if the hash exists in the cache.
    - [x] If it exists, return the cached data immediately.
    - [x] If it does not exist, proceed with the OCR processing (from Story 1.2), and after getting the result, use the `CacheService` to store it before returning the response.
- [x] **Task 5: Update Dependencies**
    - [x] Add `redis` to the `pyproject.toml` file.
- [x] **Task 6: Write Tests**
    - [x] Write unit tests for the `CacheService`, mocking the `redis-py` client to test the get/set/ttl logic.
    - [x] Write unit tests for the hashing utility.
    - [x] Update the integration tests for `/extract` to cover both cache hit and cache miss scenarios.

## Dev Notes
This story introduces caching, a critical non-functional requirement. It will modify the main workflow in the `/extract` endpoint.

### Previous Story Insights
*   This story depends on the FastAPI application from Story 1.1 and the `/extract` endpoint structure from Story 1.2.

### Relevant Architecture
*   **Component**: This story implements the `Cache Service`. Its responsibilities are defined in `architecture.md#5-5-cache-service-services-cache-py`.
*   **Tech Stack**: `Redis 7.2`, `redis-py 5.0.7`. [Source: `architecture.md#3-2-technology-stack-table`]
*   **Database Schema**: The Redis key/value structure is defined in `architecture.md#9-1-redis-cache-structure`. The key MUST be a SHA-256 hash and the value MUST be the JSON string of the full response.
*   **Core Workflows**: The integration logic must follow the sequence diagram in `architecture.md#7-1-invoice-extraction-cache-miss` and the implied logic for a cache hit.

### Testing
*   Use the `fakeredis` library or mock the `redis.Redis` client in unit tests to avoid needing a live Redis server.
*   For integration tests, the `redis` service in `docker-compose.yml` will be available, allowing for tests against a real Redis instance.

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment**: GOOD - The Redis cache implementation is well-structured with good test coverage and proper error handling. Some performance and reliability improvements have been implemented during review.

**Key Strengths**:
- **Complete AC Implementation**: All 6 acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Excellent test coverage for cache service, utils, and API integration
- **Proper Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when Redis is unavailable
- **Security-Conscious**: SHA-256 hashing ensures data integrity and prevents cache poisoning
- **Docker Integration**: Well-configured Redis service with persistence and networking

### Refactoring Performed

**File**: `app/services/cache_service.py`
- **Change**: Enhanced Redis client configuration with connection pooling, timeouts, and ping test
- **Why**: Prevents hanging connections, improves resource management, and ensures connection health  
- **How**: Added max_connections=10, socket timeouts, retry_on_timeout, and connection validation

**File**: `app/utils.py`
- **Change**: Added input validation to calculate_file_hash function
- **Why**: Prevents runtime errors from invalid input and improves defensive programming
- **How**: Added None and type checking with descriptive error messages

**File**: `tests/test_utils.py`
- **Change**: Added test cases for input validation scenarios
- **Why**: Ensures the validation logic works correctly and provides good error messages
- **How**: Added tests for None input and invalid type inputs

### Compliance Check

- **Project Structure**: ✓ Files organized according to architecture.md specifications
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ Comprehensive unit and integration tests with proper mocking
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ All 6 acceptance criteria fully implemented and validated

### Improvements Checklist

**Completed during review:**

- [x] Enhanced Redis connection management with pooling and timeouts (cache_service.py)
- [x] Added connection health checking with ping validation (cache_service.py)  
- [x] Added input validation to hash utility function (utils.py)

**Recommended for future consideration:**

- [ ] Consider adding cache metrics/monitoring for production observability
- [ ] Consider implementing cache key prefixing for multi-tenant scenarios
- [ ] Add integration tests with real Redis instance in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Consider implementing cache warming strategies for frequently accessed data

### Security Review

**PASS** - Security implementation follows best practices:
- ✅ SHA-256 hashing prevents cache poisoning and ensures data integrity
- ✅ Redis configuration uses localhost/internal networking only
- ✅ No sensitive data logged (only hash prefixes shown)
- ✅ Proper error handling prevents information disclosure
- ✅ Connection validation prevents unauthorized access scenarios

### Performance Considerations

**GOOD** - Performance optimized for production:
- ✅ Connection pooling reduces connection overhead (max_connections=10)
- ✅ Efficient JSON serialization/deserialization
- ✅ TTL implementation prevents memory bloat (24-hour expiration)
- ✅ Hash-based caching provides O(1) lookup performance
- ✅ Graceful degradation maintains performance when Redis unavailable

**Performance Metrics**:
- Cache key generation: O(1) time complexity with SHA-256
- Redis operations: O(1) for get/set operations
- Memory usage: Limited by TTL and Redis max memory settings
- Network optimization: Connection pooling reduces TCP overhead

### Files Modified During Review

**Modified:**
- `app/services/cache_service.py` - Enhanced connection management and error handling
- `app/utils.py` - Added input validation for defensive programming  
- `tests/test_utils.py` - Added validation test coverage

**Note**: Dev should update File List in story to include these QA improvements.

### Gate Status
