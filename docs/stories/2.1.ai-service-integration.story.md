# Story 2.1: AI Service Integration

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** system,
**I want** to send extracted OCR text to an AI service,
**so that** I can receive structured, validated data in a JSON format.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. An `AIService` is implemented that can take text as input and call the Google Gemini API.
2. A `PromptManager` is created to build a structured prompt for invoice data extraction.
3. The `AIService` uses the prompt from the `PromptManager` to guide the AI.
4. The AI's response (a JSON string) is parsed and validated against the `InvoiceData` Pydantic model.
5. The `/extract` endpoint is updated to call the `AIService` after OCR is complete and return the structured JSON data.
6. The service includes a placeholder for fallback logic to other AI providers (e.g., OpenAI/Claude), but the implementation of the fallback is not in scope for this story.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1: Implement Prompt Manager** (AC: 2, 3)
    - [x] Create `app/prompts/invoice_prompts.py`.
    - [x] Create a function that takes OCR text and table data and embeds it into a detailed, structured prompt instructing the AI to return JSON.
- [x] **Task 2: Implement AI Service** (AC: 1, 4)
    - [x] Create `app/services/ai_service.py`.
    - [x] Implement a class `AIService` that initializes the `google-generativeai` client.
    - [x] The client MUST be configured using an API key from the environment variables (`config.py`).
    - [x] Create a method `get_structured_data(text)` that takes the OCR text, gets a prompt from the `PromptManager`, calls the Gemini API, and receives the response.
    - [x] Parse the JSON response from the AI and use Pydantic to validate it against the `InvoiceData` schema from `app/schemas.py`.
- [x] **Task 3: Integrate AI Service into API Endpoint** (AC: 5)
    - [x] In the `/extract` endpoint, after the OCR service runs, pass its text output to the `AIService`.
    - [x] Replace the plain text response with the structured JSON data from the `AIService`.
    - [x] Ensure the full response matches the `ExtractionResponse` schema defined in the API spec.
- [x] **Task 4: Implement Fallback Placeholder** (AC: 6)
    - [x] In the `AIService`, add comments or a placeholder function to indicate where fallback logic for other AI providers would be added in the future.
- [x] **Task 5: Update Dependencies**
    - [x] Add `google-generativeai` to `pyproject.toml`.
- [x] **Task 6: Write Tests**
    - [x] Write unit tests for the `AIService`, mocking the `google-generativeai` client. Test the prompt creation, API call, and Pydantic validation logic.
    - [x] Write unit tests for the `PromptManager`.
    - [x] Update the integration tests for `/extract` to mock the `AIService` and test the new end-to-end flow.

## Dev Notes
This is a critical story that implements the core "intelligence" of the service. The quality of the prompt in the `PromptManager` will directly impact the accuracy of the final output.

### Relevant Architecture
*   **Component**: This story implements the `AI Service` (`architecture.md#5-4`) and `Prompt Manager` (`architecture.md#5-6`).
*   **External APIs**: This story integrates with the `Google Gemini API` as detailed in `architecture.md#6-1`. The API key MUST be handled securely via the config service.
*   **Data Models**: The output of this service MUST conform to the `InvoiceData` model and its sub-models, as defined in `architecture.md#4-data-models`. The final endpoint response should match `ExtractionResponse` from `architecture.md#8-rest-api-spec`.
*   **Error Handling**: The architecture specifies a retry policy and circuit breaker for external API calls (`architecture.md#12-3`). While a full circuit breaker might be out of scope for this initial story, the implementation should include basic retry logic for transient API errors.

### Testing
*   The `google-generativeai` client must be mocked in all unit tests to avoid making real API calls.
*   Focus tests on ensuring the data passed to the mocked client is correct and that the service correctly parses and validates various mocked responses (both valid and invalid JSON).
