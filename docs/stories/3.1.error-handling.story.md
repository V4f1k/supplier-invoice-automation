# Story 3.1: Error Handling

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to implement a robust error handling strategy,
**so that** the service can handle unexpected issues gracefully and provide informative feedback to the client.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A centralized exception handling middleware is added to the FastAPI application.
2. The middleware catches all unhandled exceptions and returns a standardized JSON error response compliant with the `ApiError` schema.
3. A hierarchy of custom exception classes is created (e.g., `AppException`, `OcrError`, `AiServiceError`).
4. The `AIService` implements a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for transient errors from the Gemini API.
5. A basic circuit breaker pattern is implemented for the `AIService` to prevent cascading failures.
6. The service does not crash when encountering errors like invalid files, failing API calls, or unexpected exceptions.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1: Create Custom Exceptions** (AC: 3)
    - [x] Create a new file `app/exceptions.py`.
    - [x] Define a base `AppException` class.
    - [x] Define specific exceptions like `InvalidFileTypeError`, `OcrError`, and `AiServiceError` that inherit from the base class.
- [x] **Task 2: Implement Exception Middleware** (AC: 1, 2)
    - [x] In `app/main.py` (or a new `app/middleware.py`), create a middleware or exception handler.
    - [x] The handler should catch the base `AppException` and any standard `Exception`.
    - [x] It must log the full exception and return a `JSONResponse` with a 500 status code (or a more specific one if available from the custom exception) and a body matching the `ApiError` schema.
- [x] **Task 3: Implement Retry Logic** (AC: 4)
    - [x] In `app/services/ai_service.py`, wrap the Gemini API call in a retry decorator or loop.
    - [x] Use a library like `tenacity` or implement a manual loop with `time.sleep`.
    - [x] The retry should trigger on specific transient errors (e.g., HTTP 5xx, 429 Rate Limit).
- [x] **Task 4: Implement Circuit Breaker** (AC: 5)
    - [x] In `app/services/ai_service.py`, implement a simple circuit breaker.
    - [x] Use a library like `pybreaker` or a manual implementation that tracks failures.
    - [x] After a configured number of consecutive failures, the circuit should "open" and fail fast for a set period.
- [x] **Task 5: Integrate and Refactor** (AC: 6)
    - [x] Refactor existing services (`ocr_service`, `ai_service`) to raise the new custom exceptions where appropriate.
    - [x] For example, the file validation logic in the `/extract` endpoint should raise `InvalidFileTypeError`.
- [x] **Task 6: Write Tests**
    - [x] Write unit tests for the exception middleware to ensure it catches errors and formats responses correctly.
    - [x] Write unit tests for the retry and circuit breaker logic in the `AIService` (using mocks to simulate API failures).
    - [x] Write integration tests that trigger specific errors (e.g., by uploading a wrong file type) and assert that the correct error response is returned.

## Dev Notes
This story implements a critical set of non-functional requirements that make the service production-ready. The implementation should closely follow the detailed strategy laid out in the architecture document.

### Relevant Architecture
*   **Error Handling Strategy**: This story is the direct implementation of `architecture.md#12-error-handling-strategy`. All details regarding the exception hierarchy, logging, and specific patterns are defined there.
*   **API Spec**: The error response format MUST match the `ApiError` schema in `architecture.md#8-rest-api-spec`.
*   **Logging**: The exception handling middleware must integrate with the `Loguru` logger and include the `request_id` in all error logs, as specified in `architecture.md#12-2-logging-standards`.

### Testing
*   Testing is critical for this story. You must simulate various failure modes to ensure the error handling works as expected.
*   Use mocking to simulate external API failures (HTTP 500, 429, timeouts) to test the retry and circuit breaker mechanisms.
*   Use `pytest.raises` to assert that the correct custom exceptions are raised by the services.
