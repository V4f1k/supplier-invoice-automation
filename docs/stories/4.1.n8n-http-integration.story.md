# Story 4.1: N8N HTTP Integration

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** N8N workflow developer,
**I want** simplified HTTP Request node integration with the invoice extraction service,
**so that** I can easily create workflows without complex payload handling or binary data issues.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. HTTP Request node can connect to the service with minimal configuration
2. Service accepts standard base64 file data in simple JSON format
3. Clear error responses help troubleshoot N8N workflow issues
4. Service provides health check endpoint for N8N monitoring
5. API documentation includes N8N-specific examples
6. Binary data handling works reliably without workarounds

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Create simplified N8N endpoint (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Design simple payload model with just data/filename/mimetype
  - [x] Implement `/extract-simple` endpoint
  - [x] Add request validation for required fields
- [x] Enhance error handling for N8N (AC: 3)
  - [x] Standardize error response format with success/error structure
  - [x] Add specific error codes for common issues
  - [x] Include timestamp and details in error responses
- [x] Add health check endpoint (AC: 4)
  - [x] Implement `/health/detailed` endpoint
  - [x] Include service status and available endpoints
  - [x] Add timestamp for monitoring
- [x] Update API documentation (AC: 5)
  - [x] Add OpenAPI examples for N8N HTTP Request node
  - [x] Include response samples for success and error cases
  - [x] Add N8N-specific configuration notes
- [x] Test N8N integration (AC: 6)
  - [x] Test with actual N8N HTTP Request node
  - [x] Verify binary data handling works without base64 conversion issues
  - [x] Validate error scenarios return proper HTTP status codes

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Info
- Main API endpoints: `app/api/v1/endpoints.py`
- Current N8N endpoint: `/extract-n8n` (line 198+)
- Models: `N8NBinaryFile`, `N8NRequest` classes (lines 35-49)
- Error handling: Custom exceptions in `app/exceptions.py`

### Current N8N Implementation Issues
Based on CHANGES.md analysis:
- Current `/extract-n8n` endpoint has complex payload handling with multiple fallback fields
- N8N has issues with multipart/form-data, hence the base64 JSON approach
- Current model tries to handle too many payload variations
- Error responses may not be N8N-friendly format

### Architecture Context
- Service uses FastAPI with async/await patterns
- Pydantic models for request/response validation
- Redis caching with SHA-256 file hashes
- Docker deployment with Tailscale networking (100.84.233.27:8000)
- Custom exception handling middleware

### Testing
Test file location: `tests/test_api/`
Test standards: pytest with async test support
Testing frameworks: pytest, httpx for async API testing
Specific requirements:
- Test N8N HTTP Request node compatibility
- Validate simplified payload handling
- Test error response format consistency
- Integration test with actual base64 encoded PDF
